        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Nicole, I am 19 years old and was born on the 27th of august of 2004. I was born in London and lived there for a few years before moving to Sydney, where we lived for eight months before moving again to Singapore where we lived for another year before finally settling down in Madrid, Spain. Before marrying my mother my dad was married so I have two older half-sisters and a half-brother, and I also have an older sister and a younger brother. I grew up in Madrid where I initially started school in the British Council and then transferred to Hastings School when I was 7.

        <h2>Growing up</h2>
        <p>
            I completed my IGCSEâ€™s and A-Levels at Hastings School, choosing a creative outlook I decided to choose Drama and Photography as my optional subjects aside from the compulsory Maths, English lit and language, Spanish, French and Co-ordinated Sciences. Narrowing down to three subjects was tough for me as I had a big passion for chemistry but still loved and thoroughly enjoyed my creative subjects such as photography. I finally decided on Maths, Biology and Chemistry as they were the subjects I felt teachers could help me out with the most, keeping my photography as a hobby. Finding the Creative Computing course made me really happy as it would give me the opportunity to study something I really enjoyed while keeping the creative outlook.

        <h2>Now and the future</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently studying a Bachelors Degree in Creative Computing, a three year course in Programming with an outlook into the creative industry, helping incorporate AR, VR and XR into our current day-to-day apps while still thinking about the socio-economic and ethical effects of what we are doing which is important as this is one of the most revolutionary industries of the time. I appreciate this course as it helps students explore areas that might not be explored in a basic Computer Science degree, such as video-games, Avatar creation for the fashion industry, music alteration and production using code and many more.

        <h2>A-level and career choices</h2>
        <p>
            Growing up, I have always been a very curious person and have always felt the need to go beyond what the human-eye can see, which could explain my passion for chemistry and final choice of career. I have always had small seed of doubt as to why the world works how it does and why things are the way they are, from things so simple as to why the sky is blue to many questions on how complex some things we take for granted in our day to day life are. The latter is the main reason as to my final career choice, as I started learning how simple appliences such as microwaves, televisions or vacuum cleaners worked I started becoming more and more interested in how technology could make such a vast difference in our lives without most people not even realising it.

        <h2>Hobbies and passions</h2>
        <p> 
            Some of my biggest passions and hobbies include: baking, photography and video edition and reading. My interest in baking is probably the hobbie I've started the earliest, this is due to the fact that my mother has also always been very passionate about baking. For as long as I can remember I have memories of us baking in the kitchen together, especially around birthdays, where my mum would create absolut masterpieces of cakes, ranging from 3D cars to princesses and always accompanying these with the best simple treats from Martha Stewarts cookbooks such as peanut butter balls and rice krispie treats. Also at a very young age, my father started reading to me every night, I was as young as 11 when I read His Dark Materials, a novel by Philip Pullman which consists of 1144 pages. From there on I could not put a book down no matter what, to the point where my parents had to take them away for me to go to sleep. Photography is a passion that started later on and blossomed further when I took on the subject in my IGCSE years, I took pictures for many events such as my brothers wedding and was in charge of recording and putting together videos on multiple occassions for my school.

        <h2>Travelling</h2>
        <p>
            My favourite thing in the world would be travelling, I have been fortunate enough to travel to many places and hope to be able to continue exploring the world in the future. I love hearing about other cultures, their histories and religions. Some of my best memories have been travelling the world such as the graduation trip my school friends and I took through Europe. We went to Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Split and Hvar.
